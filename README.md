# Number Guessing Game (C++)

## Overview
This project implements a number guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each round, the user is asked if they would like to play again.

## Features
- **Multiple Rounds**: Users can play multiple rounds without restarting the program.
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number for the user to guess.
- **Feedback**: The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- **Replay Option**: After each round, the user can choose to play again or exit.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ -o guessing_game guessing_game.cpp`).
2. Run the executable: `./guessing_game`.

### **Conclusion**

These improved projects demonstrate the power of object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes, functions, and data validation. By using classes and modular functions, the code is more structured and reusable. Additionally, adding features like replay options or input validation improves the user experience and makes the programs more robust.

The accompanying README files provide clear instructions for setting up, running, and understanding the projects, which is important for making the code accessible to others.
